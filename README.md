# Introduction

Intel® Xeon® family processors with support for Intel® Software Defined Silicon
(SDSi) allow the configuration of additional CPU features through a license
activation process.

Documentation in this repo provides information about the OS interface used to
communicate with SDSi hardware/firmware to perform CPU provisioning and other
related tasks.

# Documents

[os-interface.rst](os-interface.rst) describes SDSi enumeration, mailbox
structure, mailbox commands, and registers.
